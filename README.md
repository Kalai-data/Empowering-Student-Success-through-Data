EMPOWERING-STUDENT-SUCCESS-THROUGH-DATA
This project, ‘Empowering Student Success through Data’, leverages the power of data to enhance student outcomes, support educators, and build a thriving learning environment tailored to the unique needs of our students.

This project uses data to address challenges, uncover trends in demographics and performance, and provide actionable insights to help educators and administrators support student success effectively.

As a Data Analyst, my goal for this project is twofold
• Ensure that students who have previously struggled or failed are able to meet the minimum passing criteria.
• Elevate overall academic performance by helping students improve their grades incrementally
Through targeted analysis and insights, I aim to drive meaningful improvements in student outcomes, supporting both baseline achievement and excellence.
